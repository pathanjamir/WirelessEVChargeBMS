# Wireless EV Charger Battery Management System (BMS)

The Wireless EV Charger Battery Management System (BMS) is a software project focused on managing and optimizing the battery performance during wireless charging of electric vehicles (EVs). This BMS ensures efficient and safe charging while maintaining the health of the EV battery.

Wireless charging technology eliminates the need for physical connectors, providing a seamless and convenient charging experience for EV owners. This BMS is specifically designed to work in conjunction with wireless charging systems, optimizing charging efficiency and battery lifespan.

## Features

- Monitoring of battery voltage, current, temperature, and state of charge during wireless charging.
- Dynamic adjustment of charging power based on battery condition and temperature.
- Detection and handling of abnormal charging events, such as overheating or voltage fluctuations.
- Cell balancing to maintain uniform cell voltages and prevent degradation.
- Integration with wireless charging control to manage charging sessions.
